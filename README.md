# exploreAnkara
Although Ankara is the capital of Turkey, it remains an underexplored city in terms of tourism. Visitors and residents often have difficulty creating travel routes that match their personal preferences and moods.
 In this project, a user centered and AI supported recommendation system was developed, allowing users to view suggested routes on Google Maps. This enables a more effective exploration of Ankara’s cultural, artistic, and natural attractions.

 This project has been awarded support under the "2209-A University Students Research Projects Support Program" carried out by the Scientist Support Programs Presidency (BİDEB) of TÜBİTAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Türkiye).

SCOPE
Users fill out a form with time, budget, clothing, mood, companion, and interests.
A chatbot generates personalized trip plans based on the form inputs.
Suggested places are shown in logical order (e.g., breakfast → museum → concert).
All locations are marked on an interactive mini map for better navigation.
Plans are tailored to mood and context (e.g., calm solo vs. energetic group).
Location data is sourced from a local dataset.
